            <p>Gaga is a fast paced, high energy sport played in an octagonal pit. The more players the better! Dubbed a kinder gentler version of dodge ball, the game is played with a soft foam ball, and combines the skills of dodging, striking, running, and jumping, while trying to hit opponents with a ball below the knees. Players need to keep moving to avoid getting hit by the ball. Fun and easy, everyone gets a serious workout.</p>

              How to Play Air Hockey
              Air hockey is an individual sport that consists of two single player teams on opposite ends of the table. Players stand behind the end rail and centered behind their goal box they are trying to defend. They hold a mallet in one of their hands and place it in front of their goal box to protect the puck from going in their goal. Once the puck has crossed the centerline on your side of the table, each player attempts to strike the puck against their mallet towards their opponent's goal. There are a variety of offensive shots that can be performed to score such as the straight, angled, bank, double bank and more. Bank shots can be performed by using the side rails to bounce off of them at the right angle to score. The mallet is usually positioned about 8-14 inches in front of your goal box when playing defense and can be moved further out on offense to strike the puck for a shot.

            <p>
              Checkers is a board game played between two people on an 8x8 checked board like the one shown below. 
              Each player has 12 pieces that are like flat round disks that fit inside each of the boxes on the board. The pieces are placed on every other dark square and then staggered by rows, like shown on the board.
              Each Checkers player has different colored pieces. Sometimes the pieces are black and red or red and white.
